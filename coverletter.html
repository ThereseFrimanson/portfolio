                <h2>Hi there!</h2>
                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p class="compact">
                        Here you have a hungry and driven woman who is ready to develop truly solid, thoughtful, and
                        reliable solutions that improve everyday life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="compact">
                        Whether it is about building a digital system, creating a working process, or leading a
                        conversation, I want to create change. Not in a superficial way, but for real. For the user.
                        Within the team. In that feeling that something actually got a little bit better.
                    </p>
                    <p class="compact">
                        With an unusual background ranging from the stage to software development, via retail and some
                        municipal project management, I bring a rare combination of skills that create awareness,
                        energy, and positivity. I am used to seeing the details that build the bigger picture, getting
                        people involved, and creating the right conditions for both participation and progress.
                    </p>
                    <p class="compact">
                        I believe in change, but not just for the sake of it. It has to be rooted in real improvement. I
                        want to build solutions that last, and that make a difference for someone beyond just myself.
                    </p>
                    <p class="compact">
                        Respect, curiosity, and a sense of shared direction are important to me. I thrive in
                        environments where people can laugh, explore, think in new ways, and also be honest when things
                        feel difficult.
                    </p>
                    <p class="compact">
                        I am open to many different kinds of opportunities, as long as they feel meaningful, are
                        ethically sound, and have some kind of real impact, big or small. If you are looking for someone
                        who listens, reflects, dares, organizes, and genuinely cares, I would love to hear from you.
                        Looking forward to connecting!
                    </p>
