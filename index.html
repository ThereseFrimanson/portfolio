					<h2>Who am I?
						<br />
						A Creative Problemsolver
					</h2>
					<p>I have a broad background in retail sales, musical theatre, and now also an education
						in software development. What drives me is the desire to create technology that makes a real
						difference in people’s everyday lives.<br>

						<br>My interest in business and product development has always been there, especially in musical
						theatre where I’ve developed both myself and my characters on many levels. To find depth and
						connection within myself, and to truly reach the audience.
						Why does the character do that? Why do they go there? There always has to be a reason and a
						purpose. Nothing should be done generally, only intentionally. Without a clear thought behind
						things, you lose the magic.<br>

						<br>Sales is the same. I’ve never wanted to sell just for the sake of selling. I want every customer
						to feel safe and confident in their choices and to understand why something adds value to their
						life, and why it’s worth spending their money on the product I offer.<br>

						<br>Working in stores and using so many different systems, I kept asking myself: why are they
						designed like this? So often, it doesn’t feel like they were made for us end users.
						My curiosity kept growing, and after finishing my education, I’m now even more eager to create,
						learn and understand the why behind it all.</p>
