                        I have a broad background in retail sales, musical theatre, and now also an education in
                        software development. What drives me is the desire to create technology that makes a real
                        difference in peopleâ€™s everyday lives.
                    </p>

                    <p class="compact">
                        My interest in business and product development has always been there, especially in musical
                        theatre where Iâ€™ve developed both myself and my characters on many levels. To find depth and
                        connection within myself, and to truly reach the audience. Why does the character do that? Why
                        do they go there? There always has to be a reason and a purpose. Nothing should be done
                        generally, only intentionally. Without a clear thought behind things, you lose the magic.
                    </p>

                    <p class="compact">
                        Sales is the same. Iâ€™ve never wanted to sell just for the sake of selling. I want every customer
                        to feel safe and confident in their choices and to understand why something adds value to their
                        life, and why itâ€™s worth spending their money on the product I offer.
                    </p>

                    <p class="compact">
                        Working in stores and using so many different systems, I kept asking myself: why are they
                        designed like this? So often, it doesnâ€™t feel like they were made for us end users. My curiosity
                        kept growing, and after finishing my education, Iâ€™m now even more eager to create, learn and
                        understand the why behind it all.

                    <p>
                        Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with inspiring colleagues, supportive
                        leaders, and driven teams. Their guidance, feedback, and encouragement have shaped the

                        achieved together.
