                <p>
                    Throughout my journey, I’ve had the opportunity to work with inspiring colleagues, supportive
                    leaders, and driven teams. Their guidance, feedback, and encouragement have shaped the
                    professional I am today.<br><br>
                    Here you’ll find a few kind words from former supervisors and mentors. I’m grateful for what we
                    achieved together.

                    <p>After her developer internship with us, she has delivered more than many manage in an entire
                        year!!From building solutions with Azure AI and PowerApps systems to developing e-services and
                        IoT
                        projects with API integrations that display water temperatures online.
                        And yes, she even took on the role of project manager and got a taste of service design (and
                        nailed
                        it)!</p>

                    <p>This star is now looking for a job – so if you're smart (and like hiring people with drive,
                        heart,
                        and coding skills), don't miss out!
                        She's a future star, and she's ready to shine with you!<br>
